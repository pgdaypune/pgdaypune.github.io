cfpAlertText: |
  For this upcoming meetup, we will not be opening a new Call for Papers (CFP). Instead, we want to honor the high-quality submissions we received previously.
  The pgPune Organizing Committee will be reaching out to speakers who submitted talks for our previous events but weren't selected, giving them the first opportunity to present.

  Stay tuned for more details, and we look forward to seeing you there! 🐘
